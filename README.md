## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 + Vite |
| Routing | React Router v6 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + Radix UI (shadcn components) |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + Auth) |
| Icons | Lucide React |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `20.19.1` (see `.nvmrc`)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MRK2340/basketball-referee-manager.git
cd basketball-referee-manager

# Use the correct Node version (nvm users)
nvm use

npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

> This recreated project runs from the repository root in this environment, so the active env path is `/.env` at the project root rather than `/frontend/.env`.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev        # starts at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build → dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run lint       # run ESLint
```

## Demo Accounts

On first load, two demo accounts are seeded automatically:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Manager | `manager@demo.com` | `password` |
| Referee | `referee@demo.com` | `password` |

> **Note:** Auth is simulated via localStorage. A live Supabase connection is required for game data, assignments, payments, and messages.
